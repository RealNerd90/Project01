              <p>Intel said Tuesday that the company’s latest graphics driver (32.0.101.6734) is offering a
                power-management update that has the effect of boosting GPU performance by about 10 percent in terms of
                higher frame rate. You’ll see it first in handhelds, specifically the MSI Claw 8 AI+ and MSI Claw 7 AI+,
                but it will be rolled out to other Lunar Lake / Core Ultra 200V systems soon, Intel said.</p>

                code my way out of a wet paper bag.) In fact, Microsoft’s CEO claims that up to 30 percent of the
                company’s new code is now created with artificial intelligence.</p>

                <p class="description">
                  Razer™, the leading global lifestyle brand for gamers, today announced the launch of its new line of
                  productivity focused wireless mice, Razer Pro Click V2 Vertical Edition, and Razer Pro Click V2.
                  Designed for users who want to integrate gaming products into their work setup, the new Razer Pro
                  Click
                  V2 mice emphasize ergonomic comfort, offering all-day support with gaming precision.
                  <br>
                  Built with ergonomics in mind, Razer Pro Click V2 Vertical Edition is the brand’s first wireless
                  vertical ergonomic mouse. It features a 71.7º angle that mimics a natural handshake grip, reducing
                  strain during prolonged use. The extended thumb rest keeps the hand relaxed as the base support
                  elevates
                  the wrist for smoother movements.

                <h3>Cooler Master Brings Next-Generation Cooling to Intel Core Ultra 200S CPUs</h3>
                <p class="description">
                  The Core Ultra 200S CPUs bring significant architectural changes designed to enhance efficiency and
                  lower temperatures. While Intel’s improvements to semiconductor architecture play a big part, there’s
                  also been a design change in the form of a new socket: the LGA1851, paired with the RL-ILM (Reduced
                  Load- Integrated Lever Mechanism).
                  <br>
                  The RL-ILM aims to address some of the common thermal and mechanical issues present in older
                  mechanisms by reducing the loading pressure and providing a flatter load plate. This change mitigates
                  the risk of the CPU's IHS (Integrated Heat Spreader) bending, ensuring more consistent and direct
                  contact with the cooling plate. Cooler Master has always prioritized high-quality engineering, which
                  is why many of our cooling solutions—designed for the previous LGA1700

                <p class="description">
                  There’s a strong argument for chipping away at the overall cost of your rig by buying cheaper hardware
                  components, but how much performance you will forfeit by doing this isn’t always apparent at the time
                  you build.
                  <br>
                  A classic example of that is if you’ve only invested in a modest video card but suddenly find yourself
                  not able to play games at the resolution you want. You might have even upgraded your monitor from say
                  a
                  1080p to a 1440p one but still find you can only play at 1080p because of your bottlenecked GPU. So
                  budget where possible, but also think of the specs you need down the track.

                <h3>Tariffs could further disrupt the stability of the PC hardware market - and this new study suggests

                <p class="description">
                  While the PC hardware market has always had cases of high demand for certain desktop components
                  (notably
                  GPUs) and laptops, it's arguably now hitting unprecedented levels due to US tariffs, and a new study
                  corroborates this.

                <h3>‘Indian epic action adventure game’ The Age of Bhaarat announced for consoles, PC</h3>
                <p class="description">
                  “The Age of Bhaarat is a landmark project that aims to propel India onto the global gaming map,” reads
                  the announcement. “While India is home to a treasure trove of legendary lore, its expression in global
                  gaming has remained largely untapped. Tara Gaming Ltd. seeks to change that by merging the country’s
                  creative capital with AAA production capabilities.
                  <br>
                  At its core, the brand’s vision is to empower Indian storytellers and bridge the gap between
                  culturally
                  rooted stories and cutting-edge game development. The newly unveiled trailer teases sweeping
                  landscapes,
                  mythical beasts, powerful warriors, and layered storytelling—all brought together with cinematic
                  finesse
                  and technical brilliance. Drawing upon epics, folklore, and traditions, The Age of Bhaarat—India’s own
                  AAA game—marks a key milestone in Tara Gaming’s ‘Create in India’ ambition.”

                <h3>Tipster claims AMD's RX 9060 XT 8GB is planned to launch at Computex — Dismisses cancellation rumors
                </h3>
                <p class="description">
                  It seems that AMD's RX 9060 XT 8GB is still on track, despite rumors suggesting otherwise, per
                  Benchlife. The publication claims, through its sources, that AMD has no plans to cancel this 8GB VRAM
                  product or halt supply to board partners. It's important to note that these cancellation rumors might
                  not be completely baseless. Given the performance limitations of Nvidia's RTX 5060 Ti 8GB, AMD may be
                  inclined to prioritize the RX 9060 XT 16GB over its 8GB sibling, but that's just speculation.
                  <br>
                  The RX 9060 XT branding was officially confirmed by AMD during the RX 9000 reveal at CES. It would
                  only
                  be a matter of time before the official announcement, which is reportedly set for Computex in just
                  three
                  weeks. Taking a page out of Nvidia's playbook, AMD's RX 9060 XT has been rumored to launch in two VRAM
                  capacities: 8GB and 16GB. This further segments AMD's RDNA 4 portfolio, though we expect these GPUs to
                  hit the $350 price point.

                <h3>Nvidia RTX 50-series demand drops in Germany — cheapest models of all but RTX 5090 priced at MSRP or
                  lower</h3>
                <p class="description">
                  Nvidia's RTX 50-series product stack has seen a decline in demand in the German market. According to
                  ComputerBase, most RTX 5080, RTX 5070 Ti, and RTX 5070 AIB partner models are selling for at or below
                  their respective MSRPs. The only exception is the RTX 5090, which is still in high demand and is
                  struggling to stay on store shelves.
                  <br>
                  The cheapest variations of the RTX 5070 Ti were €869 at the end of March, and were down to €799 last
                  week — €80 cheaper than the MSRP. The cheapest RTX 5070 cards, likewise, dropped from €599 to €589
                  (both
                  of which are lower than the MSRP of €619). The RTX 5060 Ti 8GB and 16GB are too new to have pricing
                  data
                  from the end of March, but current pricing shows the cheapest versions to be right at MSRP as of last
                  week.

                <h3>Assassin's Creed Shadows announces more difficulties, more immersion options, more Jesuits, and a bo
                  staff in its year 1 roadmap</h3>
                <p class="description">
                  Assassin's Creed Shadows is the tale of Oda Nobunaga's quest to defrag Japan, and in tribute to the
                  daimyō's relentless ambition, Ubisoft has announced its post-launch roadmap for the game consisting of
                  patches, feature drops, and "height-gaining back ejects," which videogames need more of as a general
                  rule.
                  <br>
                  It looks like Shadows is set for a pretty stuffed year, all told. This month alone it's meant to get a
                  new free quest focusing on Yasuke's Portuguese Jesuit pal Luis Frois, vaguely defined "quality-of-life
                  improvements," a photo-mode update, a "special collaboration" which I'm guessing is some kind of
                  co-marketing thing like that Final Fantasy mission in Origins, and that tweak to the game's parkour.
